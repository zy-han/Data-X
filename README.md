# Uniswap Arbitraging Platform: Winning Trading Strategies for Cryptocurrencies

Team 1 - INDENG 290 - 21 Spring at Cal

## Motivation
Cryptocurrency is one of the hottest fields in investment, promising immense opportunity for those willing to take risks. While the price of Bitcoin skyrocketed from $5,000 to $60,000 and the daily trading volume reached a billion-dollar level in the past year, people’s interest in trading and swapping crypto assets has grown exponentially. However, the process is not as easy as it sounds - investors are likely to lose money due to a lack of knowledge of the market and the fast-changing exchange rates. Under the guidance of AnChain.ai, six students from the University of California, Berkeley gathered to create a platform that could recommend arbitraging strategies based on users’ preferences and boost people’s portfolios, making it less risky for cryptocurrency investors.
